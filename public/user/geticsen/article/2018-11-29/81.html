	Youth is not a time of life;<br />
<br />
it is a state of mind;<br />
<br />
it is not a matter of rosy cheeks,<br />
<br />
red lips and supple knees;<br />
<br />
it is a matter of the will,<br />
<br />
a quality of the imagination,<br />
<br />
a vigorof the emotions;<br />
<br />
it is the freshness of the deep springs of life.<br />
Youth means a temperamental predominance<br />
<br />
of courage over timidity,<br />
<br />
of the appetite for adventure over the<br />
<br />
love of ease.<br />
<br />
This often exists in a man of sixty more<br />
<br />
than a boy of twenty.<br />
<br />
Nobody grows old merely by a number of years.<br />
We grow old by deserting our ideals.<br />
Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give<br />
<br />
up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Worry, fear, self-distrust bows the heart and<br />
<br />
turns the spirit (录音误读为spring) back to dust.<br />
<br />
Whether sixty or sixteen, there is in every human<br />
<br />
being's heart the lure of wonder,<br />
<br />
the unfailing child-like appetite of what's next,<br />
<br />
and the joy of the game of living.<br />
<br />
In the center of your heart and my heart there<br />
<br />
is a wireless station;so long as it receives<br />
<br />
messages of beauty, hope, cheer,<br />
<br />
courage and power from menand from the Infinite,<br />
<br />
so long are you young.<br />
<br />
When the aerials are down,<br />
<br />
and your spirit is covered with snows of<br />
<br />
cynicism and the ice of pessimism,<br />
<br />
then youare grown old, even at twenty,<br />
<br />
but as long as your aerials are up,<br />
<br />
to catch the waves of optimism,<br />
<br />
thereis hope you may die young at eighty.
